#README - Today's Hours Script

---

This tool was developed by Matthew Reidsma in Javascript to provide an easy way .

INSTALLATION

Open the todayshours.js file in a text editor, and add your regular schedule by editing lines 21 and 26. Enter the time your library opens, starting with Sunday. If your library is closed, enter "X" for the time. In the following example, the library is closed on Sunday and opens at 9am Monday through Friday. On Saturday, the library opens at 1:30pm. The script will print whatever format you decide to use in these variables. Make sure to leave the quotes! Do the same with your closing times.

EXAMPLE:

var open=["X","9:00am","9:00am","9:00am","9:00am","9:00am","1:30pm"]; // Edit this line
var close=["X","10:00pm","10:00pm","10:00pm","10:00pm","10:00pm","9:00pm"]; // Edit this line

Now upload the todayshours.js file to your server. Whenever you want to display the hours the library is open today, simply call the Javascript file like this:

<script type="text/javascript" src="/PATH/TO/todayshours.js"></script>

You may want to offer an option for users who do not have javascript. In that case, include:

<script type="text/javascript" src="/PATH/TO/todayshours.js"></script><noscript><a href="/PATH/TO/HOURS/PAGE">Today&#8217;s hours</a></noscript>
